In this research, we will examine the effects of two separate increases in Illinois’ excise tax on liquor, one increase in July 1999 and a second increase in September 2009 on fatal alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes (FARMVC). This read-me file explains both the construction of the dataset, we will use and how we will estimate our model. Specifically, it will walk users through the file layout, downloading of related data, and use of two sets of Stata do-files.

We will be using the synthetic control method as described in Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmuller (2010). For more information, please see:

[Synthetic Control Method](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/synthetic-control-method-tool-understand-state-policy)

For the both the 1999 and 2009 tax change, we will use two different dependent variables: the share of total fatal crashes with BAC values over 0.08 (share_alcohol) and the total number of fatal crashes with BAC values over 0.08 divided by the number of drivers (drivers_alcohol).

When using the synthetic control method, an important assumption of the model is that there has been no similar policy shock in the pre-treatment period. This means that our study must proceed chronologically. We must first test to see if there was an effect of the 1999 tax increase. If no effect is found, we can then proceed to test the second, larger 2009 tax increase. As a point of clarification, we refer to the 1999 tax increase as "2000" and the 2009 tax increase as "2010" at several times in the code below. This is because the first year with a full treatment of the higher tax in both cases was the year following enactment. Given the use of annual data, we treat 2000 and 2010 as the first years of treatment (and 1998 and 2008 as the last years of the pre-treatment periods) in the synthetic control method.

An additional study is preformed that tests the effect of the policy using the same synthetic control method, but substitutes in values of IL without counties bordering other states. The "alcohol_noborders.dta" data file below will be used for that purpose.

This Do-File creates the filepaths necessary to run the dataset construction process. After running this, you will need to place the required downloaded data in the correct folders.

*   "Dataset Construction - Master.do"

This Do-File is the primary Stata do file used to construct our data. It calls up six individual do-files to clean the various data that are included in the final dataset.

It produces several files summarizing the different data sources, but the main file is:

“alcohol.dta”: This is an edited version of "Dataset (1982-2015)" with US added to make a total of 50 states plus DC and the US. A version of this file is saved in the synth folder. This file only includes the variables to be used in our model:

This do-file calls up 8 separate do files, each of which operates in its own folder. Before running the do-file, make sure that all the file paths are correct and the following instructions for downloading data from online are followed, with the downloaded data files sitting in the correct folder. Because this do-file also automatically places a final version of the dataset in the folder where the model will be run, make sure that file extension exists as well.

This file also creates "alcohol_noborders.dta" version with, which is identical to "alcohol.dta", but with the IL dependent variables calculated using only driving fatalities from internal counties in IL (an additional file with only border counties is also created, though the results are not included in our final paper).

After setting up the folders as outlined above by using "setup", you can run through the do-files in turn. It is important to not run them one after another, mainly because the results of the first affect the second, and the results of the second affect the third. The file descriptions are the same for both 2000 and 2010 (the only changes are the dates of the treatment). A note of caution - the 2009 policy is only applicable to the synthetic control method if you find no effect of the policy shock of 2000.

##### [](https://github.com/johniselin/Liquor-Taxation-and-Alcohol-Related-Driving-Fatalities#synth_setupdo)"synth_setup.do"

This do-file creates the folders used in the synth preestimation, model, and postestimation steps. Running it first allows you to run cleanly through the later do-files without concern for mixing up folders.

##### [](https://github.com/johniselin/Liquor-Taxation-and-Alcohol-Related-Driving-Fatalities#powertestdo)"powertest.do"

Before using the synthetic control method on our dataset, it is important to make sure that it (the method) could detect some standard shock - in essence, is there enough "power" in the combination of model and data to detect an effect. We select an effect size from the existing literature (Wagoner et al (2015) found a 26 percent reduction in alcohol motor vehicle fatalities in IL) and use the Monte Carlo method to determine if - when we simulate both a null effect of that policy and a 26% effect of that policy - our methodology and data can detect the difference. We first establish a benchmark by calculating 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations in which there is no treatment. In each iteration of the Monte Carlo a simulated state is created such that the share of auto fatalities in each year is the average from the donor pool plus two zero mean random variables: S(t) = d(t) + u(i) + e(it), where S(t) is the share in the simulated state in year t, d(t) is the average share in the donor pool in year t, u(i) is the fixed effect from a randomly drawn state and e(it) is a normally distributed error term with zero mean and the same standard deviation as the residual in the two-way fixed effect model. A synthetic control for the simulated state is then created using all lags of the outcome variable in the pre-treatment period. Finally, for each simulation the ratio of the post-treatment RMSPE to pre-treatment RMSPE is calculated. We then repeat the process on an additional 1,000 simulations, but create a treatment effect equal to the 26 percent decline found in Wagoner et al (2015) by multiplying the share of auto fatalities linked to alcohol in the post-treatment years by 0.74.

We examine power by following Abadie et al (2015) in calculating the post-treatment MSPE. We explore the power of the synthetic control method in this application by comparing the distributions of the MSPE calculated from the null and treatment simulations.

##### [](https://github.com/johniselin/Liquor-Taxation-and-Alcohol-Related-Driving-Fatalities#synth_preestimation_2000do-and-synth_preestimation_2010do)“synth_preestimation_2000.do” and “synth_preestimation_2010.do”

This do-file has two main parts. First, it takes the “alcohol.dta” dataset and transforms it into four files, two for each version of the model we will be running. For both tax shocks, there will be two versions of the model, one for each dependent variable: share_alcohol and drivers_alcohol. For each of these dependent variables, we run the model over our set of donor states, which is all 50 states plus DC minus states with large liquor tax changes, states with liquor control as opposed to or in addition to taxes, and Alaska, DC, and Hawaii. For sensitivity analysis, we also will re-run the models over a second set of donor states where we add back in states with liquor control boards.

Second, it creates a set of pre-estimation figures and tables for each of the two versions of the model (and the sensitivity tests). We estimate each version on two donor pools (the larger pool is part of a sensitivity analysis described below). It shows the average for all the variables in that model by state for 1982 – 1998 and the average of all the variables across time for Illinois. It then creates a bar graph showing the average for all the variables in that model by state for 1982 – 1998, to allow us to look for outliers, and situations where IL is an outlier (if that is the case that variable should not be used in this model). Finally, it plots the dependent variable of the model for IL and the US in the pre-treatment period (1982-1998), and from this figure we can determine which lagged values of the dependent are appropriate to include in our model.

Note: This file will only work if you have the file paths correctly assigned.

Note: This file is organized without loops, mainly due to the need to label figures properly. This means if you do make any major changes, you must check 8 places – 4 models * 2 sections.

##### [](https://github.com/johniselin/Liquor-Taxation-and-Alcohol-Related-Driving-Fatalities#synth_model_2000do-and-synth_model_2010do)“synth_model_2000.do” and “synth_model_2010.do”

This file takes the datasets created in synth_preestimation and runs through our model. The model is run twice for each version of the data (described above) - once with all pre-treatment dependent variable lags, and once with our selected explanatory variables plus lags selected based on our pre-estimation tests. This file also runs the versions through placebo tests, which run each potential donor state through the same model IL was run through (both all lags and our chosen model), to determine if the IL result is different from that seen in other states. For each of the two models, this do-file also runs through the sensitivity analysis using the larger pool of donor states.

The choice of lagged dependent variables for our model comes from the results of the pre-estimation tests, and is listed in the do-file. If you run the pre-estimation tests and decide on a different set, you have to go into the loop and change those years (not a local).

Note: This file loops over the four model/donor pool combinations, so to change the variables or states in the model you simply must change the locals listed at the top.

Note: The donor states used in each version of the model and their weights are captured in a dataset at the end of this do-file.

Note: We use the placebo test section of this code to check for an effect using an alternative pre-treatment period for the 2000 drivers model. We detect a potential effect of the tax change if we restrict the pre-treatment period to 1990-1998 (as opposed to 1982-1998) so we run the placebo tests on the narrow and controls donor pools, using a file called "synth_placebo_pretreatment.do" which is attached.

##### [](https://github.com/johniselin/Liquor-Taxation-and-Alcohol-Related-Driving-Fatalities#synth_postestimation_2000do-and-synth_postestimation_2010do)“synth_postestimation_2000.do” and “synth_postestimation_2010.do”

This do-file is the third of three. This file takes the datasets created in synth_preestimation and runs through a series of post-estimation tests for each version of the data. The tests are as follows. First, we vary the lags used in the model to determine if the results are sensitive to the chosen lags. Second, we vary the pre-intervention period to determine if the results are sensitive to the starting point of our data. Third, we test the importance of each state used in the synthetic Illinois by sequentially drop each donor state selected by the synth code. Finally, to test the possibility that our results are due to a small number of potential donor states we enlarge the donor pool by including states with liquor control boards.

Note: This file loops over the four model/donor pool combinations, so to change the variables or states in the model you simply have to change the locals listed at the top.

##### [](https://github.com/johniselin/Liquor-Taxation-and-Alcohol-Related-Driving-Fatalities#analysis_depvar_donorpoolxlsx)"Analysis_*depvar_donorpool*.xlsx"

These excel files are set up to receive output directly from "synth_model.dta" and "synth_postestimation.dta". There are 8 files, one each for the combination of tax increase year (1999 and 2009) (Note that we use the first full year of the tax increase as the first year of the effect, so the labeling follows 2000 and 2010), the dependent variable (share or driver) and the size of the donor pool (narrow or controls). Each is set up to produce figures for the following: All-lags sythetic control model, selected lags and predictor variable synthetic control model, placebo test with all-lags model, placebo test with selected lags and predictor model, alternative lag test, alternative pre-treatment period test, and leave-one-out test. Some notes: there are some labels and cells that need to be adjusted model to model (sorting correclty and expanding selections for figures as the number of donor state's change, for example. Moving from 2000 to 2009 means adjusting the language slightly, and most importantly, changing the area selected for calculating the RMSE of the pre-treatment period for the placebo tests.
